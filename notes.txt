1. Abstract User creation
- We created a model and added to settings.py
- Created a form to specify how to create User
- Register CustomUser in admin
2. CORS + CSRF
- cors headers va csrf trust qoshiladi

<!> Until now, anyone can access CRUD operations. Now we change Permissions!

3. Create Simple User and Auth page in browsable API
- We got that rest_framework.urls have its own login and logout pages that we only need to add in project urls to show them.
-  View-Levelda permission_classes orqali IsAdminUser qilsak, detail pageni admindan boshqasi kora olmaydi
